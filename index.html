        <h1>Concept Graphs for Learning and Search</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This project aims at developing a system for automatic generation of concept graphs from natural language text, and which allows building useful applications on top of it. For the purpose of demonstration, a web service which allows embedding concept graphs into web pages has been built. A concept graph is a representation of entities extracted out of a paragraph, represented as nodes in the graph and relationships between the entities as the edges connecting different nodes.</p>
